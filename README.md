# CodingInterviewProblems
A bunch of problems to solve before a coding interview

Each rb file has the problem description in comments at the top of the source file. Each problem has a unit test
associated with it. Once you complete the solution run the ruby test by running:

`ruby test/<nameofproblem>.rb` 

For example:

`ruby test/valid_anagram_test.rb`

Here is a list of problems found in this project:
* Rotate an array to the right (array_rotation.rb)
* Find the first non repeating character (first_non_repeating.rb)
* Ensure if a string has properly nested brackets (nesting.rb)
* Check for valid anagrams (valid_anagram.rb)
* Find the missing plus two element (missing_plus_two.rb)

**Solutions to all problems can be found in the branch solutions**
